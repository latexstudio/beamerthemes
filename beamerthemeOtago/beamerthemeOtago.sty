% Highlight a piece of text using the alert colour and also by drawing a
% frame around it. We need to ensure that the "unhighlighted" version is
% drawn in a box of the same height as the "highlighted" version. Thus the
% use of \boxheight, \boxdepth and \boxtotalheight to control things.
%
% We draw the "unhighlighted" version as is. We draw the "highlighted"
% version in a box of the same height by using \raisebox to make TeX think
% that the framed text is actually the same height as the original text
% (we don't raise the text at all).
%
% Since different texts will have different ascenders and descenders, we
% insert a strut to ensure that all the frames come out with the same total
% height.
%
% Note that the frame will always be drawn in the handout, but the alert
% colour won't.

% We want to use the \part macro to break up the document into parts,
% but without resetting the section counters and navigation bars. Some
% of this is keyed off the use of the part counter, so the easiest way
% to avoid it is to create a new part counter and redefine the \part
% macro to use that. (This may be an argument for changing the way
% lecture slides are structured, but later...)
